# Art Institute Of Chicago Catalog App

We want to build a mobile application that allows a user to navigate the catalog of artworks exposed by the Art Institute of Chicago API.

# Documentation | Art Institute of Chicago API

The user should be able to see a thumbnail and a small description of each artwork in the main screen of the app. When clicking on a thumbnail the user must be sent to a detailed screen of the artwork containing a better quality image and more detailed information about the piece, the author, and any other data you consider might be relevant for the end user. The user should be able to save some favorite artworks, and should be able to explore them even after the application is completely closed and reopened.

## NOTES:
- You should use animated transitions and any other cool feature you consider will show up how experienced you are in mobile development.
- Your solution will be evaluated on code quality, clarity and development best practices.
- Build the application using React Native CLI and Typescript.
- Additional bonus if you implement some kind of push notifications.
